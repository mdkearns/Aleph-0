		<h1>A Web-Based Search Assistant: Aleph-0</h1>
		<h1>CS4640 Final Project Proposal</h1>
		<h3>Matt Kearns</h3>
		</center>
		</div>
			
		<br/><h2>High-Level Description</h2><br/>
		
			<p>
				Aleph-0 uses both the Wolfram|Alpha Computational Knowledge Engine and the Wikipedia Search Engine 
				to generate search results. Aleph-0 is designed to make traversing the web for general knowledge easy. 
				Wolfram|Alpha and Wikipedia do the heavy lifting for this application. This web-based search assistant 
				will not only help query knowledge, but will also help you retain it. Each query made through Aleph-0 can
				be saved for later review. In order to view past queries, the user must create an account with Aleph-0.
				Of course, a user may use Aleph-0 without having an account, but doing so will only afford limited functionality.
				Aleph-0 has the following features:
				
				<br/>
				<ul>
					<li>Personalized Page</li>
					<li>Web Search Form</li>
					<li>Save Web Search</li>
					<li>Review Past Queries</li>
					<li>Visualization Tools</li>
				</ul>
				
				Aleph-0 provides its users with a simple, yet complete interface upon log in. The user is able to specify a 
				search type prior to submitting the web search form in order to help Aleph-0 return results faster from the 
				correct knowledge engine. If Aleph-0 is able to successfully query results about the user's search, then it
				will generate a results section in two parts: a query title and a query answer. The user then has the ability 
				to save these results for later in the form of a flash card. This ability, however, is only possible if the user
				has an account with Aleph-0. Of course, Aleph-0 also provides the ability to visualize user statistics, such as
				the total number of queries made by the user, the number of successful and unsuccessful queries, and the number 
				of saved queries.<br/><br/>
				
				Aleph-0 will help you learn new things and visualize your usage statistics, but how did Aleph-0 get its name? 
				In set theory, <img src="images/aleph-0.gif"> is a number that is used to represent the size of a countably infinite
				set. This refers to the cardinality of a set. For example, a set that can be put into one-to-one correspondence with 
				the natural numbers is considered to be of size <img src="images/aleph-0.gif">. As per Wikipedia,
				
				<br/><br/>
				<blockquote>
					"...the aleph numbers are a sequence of numbers used to represent the cardinality of infinite sets that can 
					be well-ordered. They are named after the symbol used to denote them, the Hebrew letter aleph."
				</blockquote>
				
				The Hebrew letter, aleph, is the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet, and alpha is the first letter of the greek alphabet.
				The name is meant to be a play on the word Alpha in Wolfram|Alpha. A computational knowledge/search engine named after a counting number
				used to define infinite sets seems to be fitting.

		<br/><h2>Technical Details</h2><br/>
		
			<h3>Functional Requirements</h3>
			
			<p>
				Every well-defined project has functional requirements that must be met. Aleph-0 must be able to do the following: 
			</p>
			
			<ol>
				<li>Provide a space for users to log in</li>
				<li>Display a custom page for a 'logged in' user</li>
				<li>Display a generic page for general users</li>
				<li>Successfully query knowledge from Wikipedia and Wolfram|Alpha</li>
				<li>Display search results in a visually pleasing manner to its user</li>
				<li>Provide the ability for a user to save query results to later</li>
				<li>Provide the ability for a user to view their Aleph-0 usage statistics</li>
			</ol>
			
			<p>
				In the next few paragraphs, we will see how we can successfully acheive these high-level functional requirements, while
				defining several more technical requirements related to the front- and back-end functionality.
			</p>
			
			
			<h3>Front-End Functionality and Description</h3>
			
			<p>
				On the client side, the program must provide a space for the user to log in. Upon receving the webpage for Aleph-0, a generic 
				version of Aleph-0 will be displayed to the user, and a button for logging into a user account will be present in the upper
				right corner of the viewport. Clicking the log in button opens an authentication page, where the user can securely type in their
				account username and password. Pressing the submit button starts the authentication process, and the user will be redirected to 
				page customized for them (i.e. display their name at the top). At their page, the user can specify, using a drop down menu, the
				type of query they wish to perform: a computational type query or a general knowledge type query. This user-specification is used
				by the application to help branch to the correct knowledge engine for search results; however, an unsuccessful attempt to query knowledge
				from one engine will result in the attempt to query results from the other. Therefore, it is to the user's advantage to specify the 
				correct type of query each time in order for Aleph-0 to return faster results. Each saved query by the user is displayed in a small table
				that holds a query number and title, so that the user can retrieve these results later.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The front-end code is also responsible for handling the dynamic display of information to the user. Through AJAX requests to PHP back-end code,
				the JavaScript front-end will be able to dynamically display information to the user, such as search results, saved searches, and usage statistics.
				AJAX requests will also be used to asynchronously communicate back the results from the Wolfram|Alpha and Wikipedia knowledge engines for display of
				initial query results.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Communicating with Wolfram|Alpha and Wikipedia</h3>
			
			<p>
				Communication with the external knowledge engines is made easy through Asynchrounous AJAX requests. An AJAX request can be made to retrieve search results
				from Wolfram|Alpha or Wikipedia. Doing so, however, requires a bit more work on the front end for displaying the results of a new query. Much of the work for 
				displaying results can be done on the server side once a query is saved to the database. Wikipedia provides textual descriptions for search results, while 
				Wolfram|Alpha provides pictorial descriptions. The front-end code will need to handle the rendering of information from these sources differently.
			</p>
			
			
			<h3>Back-End Functionality and Description</h3>
			
			<p>
				On the server side, the program must be able to store previous query results upon request from the user. The back-end PHP code will be used to 
				communicate with the MySQL Database Management System (DBMS) and relate results back to the client by encoding the results in the JSON format. The
				back-end PHP code will also need to handle user account authentication by communicating with a user table in the database. The PHP code will indicate
				that a user has successfully logged in if the user-supplied account credentials are in the database. The PHP code will send information back to the client, 
				so that the client will be able to render a unique, customized page for its user. The PHP back-end code will divide its tasks into three parts as per the 
				MVC framework: a model used to store and retrieve information from the database, a controller used to control queries sent to the database through 
				user-supplied input (i.e. a command to store new query results vs. retrieving past query results), and a view used to structure information to be returned to
				the client. Each query will have a unique identifier, so that the user can retrieve past queries more easily.
