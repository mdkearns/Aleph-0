# Aleph-0

Overview:

Aleph-0 is a web-based search assistant that can be used to query both general and computational knowledge from knowledge engines. Currently, Aleph-0 is set up to query knowledge from the Wolfram|Alpha and Wikipedia knowledge engines. When a user signs up for an account, they gain access to an additional feature: the ability to store past queries for later viewing.
	

	Instructions for running the web application:
	
	
	Create 1 database and 2 tables using the dump.sql file located in the sql_dump directory.
	
	* A user 'dbuser' with password 'cs4640' must be created in the system in order for the application to work properly.
  	* Required images are in the images directory: aleph-icon.png and modern.jpg
	
	Proceed to the index.html (not index.php) page to view the generic page displayed to the general user.
	
	Two users exist in the database:
	
	Matt Kearns:
